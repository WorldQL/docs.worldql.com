# Entities

Entities represent temporary and dynamic objects in a World. They can be used for:
- NPCs
- Enemies and ambient creatures
- Players (sometimes)
  - If you're using WorldQL to compliment an existing game server, it's better to simply use a LocalMessage to pass information about player state.


:::caution Coming soon!

Entities in WorldQL are coming soon! They will be released publicly alongside our scripting environment in Q2 2022. If you're interested in getting access early, please email us at hello@worldql.com
