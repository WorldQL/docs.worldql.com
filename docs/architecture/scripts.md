# Scripts

Scripts allow you to program dynamic behavior inside WorldQL. This environment is familiar to anyone who has used an ECS before. Scripts can be used to allow Entities to dynamically interact with each other or to run scheduled tasks on your World.

:::caution Coming soon!

Scripts in WorldQL are coming soon! They will be released publicly alongside Entities in Q2 2022. If you're interested in getting access early, please email us at hello@worldql.com
